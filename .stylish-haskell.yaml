# Default stylish-haskell configuration file in Serokell.
# It's based on default config provided by `stylish-haskell --defaults` but has some changes
# ==================================

# The stylish-haskell tool is mainly configured by specifying steps. These steps
# are a list, so they have an order, and one specific step may appear more than
# once (if needed). Each file is processed by these steps in the given order.
steps:
  # Finally we decided to disable unicode_syntax
  # - unicode_syntax:
  #     # We disable `add_language_pragma` feature because
  #     # we have `UnicodeSyntax` in `default-extensions`
  #     add_language_pragma: false

  # Align the right hand side of some elements.  This is quite conservative
  # and only applies to statements where each element occupies a single
  # line.
  - simple_align:
      cases: true
      top_level_patterns: true
      records: true

  # Import cleanup
  - imports:
      # There are different ways we can align names and lists.
      #
      # - global: Align the import names and import list throughout the entire
      #   file.
      #
      # - file: Like global, but don't add padding when there are no qualified
      #   imports in the file.
      #
      # - group: Only align the imports per group (a group is formed by adjacent
      #   import lines).
      #
      # - none: Do not perform any alignment.
      #
      # Default: global.
      align: global

  # Language pragmas
  - language_pragmas:
      # We can generate different styles of language pragma lists.
      #
      # - vertical: Vertical-spaced language pragmas, one per line.
      #
      # - compact: A more compact style.
      #
      # - compact_line: Similar to compact, but wrap each line with
      #   `{-#LANGUAGE #-}'.
      #
      # Default: vertical.
      style: vertical

      # stylish-haskell can detect redundancy of some language pragmas. If this
      # is set to true, it will remove those redundant pragmas. Default: true.
      remove_redundant: true

  # Replace tabs by spaces. This is disabled by default.
  # - tabs:
  #     # Number of spaces to use for each tab. Default: 8, as specified by the
  #     # Haskell report.
  #     spaces: 8

  # Remove trailing whitespace
  - trailing_whitespace: {}

# A common setting is the number of columns (parts of) code will be wrapped
# to. Different steps take this into account. Default: 80.
columns: 90

# By default, line endings are converted according to the OS. You can override
# preferred format here.
#
# - native: Native newline format. CRLF on Windows, LF on other OSes.
#
# - lf: Convert to LF ("\n").
#
# - crlf: Convert to CRLF ("\r\n").
#
# Default: native.
newline: native

# These are exactly the same extensions which we enable in .cabal file
# Some of them shouldn't affect stylish-haskell, but let them be
language_extensions:
  - OverloadedStrings
  - RecordWildCards
  - DeriveDataTypeable
  - GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving
